Overview
Welcome to Twelve Data developer docs — your gateway to comprehensive financial market data through a powerful and easy-to-use API. Twelve Data provides access to financial markets across over 50 global countries, covering more than 1 million public instruments, including stocks, forex, ETFs, mutual funds, commodities, and cryptocurrencies.

Quickstart
To get started, you'll need to sign up for an API key. Once you have your API key, you can start making requests to the API.

Step 1: Create Twelve Data account
Sign up on the Twelve Data website to create your account here. This gives you access to the API dashboard and your API key.

Step 2: Get your API key
After signing in, navigate to your dashboard to find your unique API key. This key is required to authenticate all API and WebSocket requests.

Step 3: Make your first request
Try a simple API call with cURL to fetch the latest price for Apple (AAPL):

curl "https://api.twelvedata.com/price?symbol=AAPL&apikey=your_api_key"
Step 4: Make a request from Python or Javascript
Use our client libraries or standard HTTP clients to make API calls programmatically. Here’s an example in Python and Node.js:

Python (using official Twelve Data SDK):
from twelvedata import TDClient

# Initialize client with your API key
td = TDClient(apikey="your_api_key")

# Get latest price for Apple
price = td.price(symbol="AAPL").as_json()

print(price)
JavaScript (Node.js):
import { MarketDataApi, CreateConfig } from "@twelvedata/twelvedata-node";

const config = CreateConfig('your_api_key');
const api = new MarketDataApi(config);

async function main() {
  const response = await api.getPrice({
    symbol: "AAPL",
  });
  console.log(response.data);
}

main().catch(console.error);
Step 5: Perform correlation analysis between Tesla and Microsoft prices
Fetch historical price data for Tesla (TSLA) and Microsoft (MSFT) and calculate the correlation of their closing prices:

from twelvedata import TDClient
import pandas as pd

# Initialize client with your API key
td = TDClient(apikey="your_api_key")

# Fetch historical price data for Tesla
tsla_ts = td.time_series(
    symbol="TSLA",
    interval="1day",
    outputsize=100
).as_pandas()

# Fetch historical price data for Microsoft
msft_ts = td.time_series(
    symbol="MSFT",
    interval="1day",
    outputsize=100
).as_pandas()

# Align data on datetime index
combined = pd.concat(
    [tsla_ts['close'].astype(float), msft_ts['close'].astype(float)],
    axis=1,
    keys=["TSLA", "MSFT"]
).dropna()

# Calculate correlation
correlation = combined["TSLA"].corr(combined["MSFT"])
print(f"Correlation of closing prices between TSLA and MSFT: {correlation:.2f}")
Authentication
Authenticate your requests using one of these methods:

Query parameter method
GET https://api.twelvedata.com/endpoint?symbol=AAPL&apikey=your_api_key
HTTP header method (recommended)
Authorization: apikey your_api_key
API key useful information
Demo API key (apikey=demo) available for demo requests
Personal API key required for full access
Premium endpoints and data require higher-tier plans (testable with trial symbols)
API endpoints
Service	Base URL
REST API	https://api.twelvedata.com
WebSocket	wss://ws.twelvedata.com
Parameter guidelines
Separator: Use & to separate multiple parameters
Case sensitivity: Parameter names are case-insensitive (symbol=AAPL = symbol=aapl)
Multiple values: Separate with commas where supported
Response handling
Default format
All responses return JSON format by default unless otherwise specified.

Null values
Important: Some response fields may contain null values when data is unavailable for specific metrics. This is expected behavior, not an error.

Best Practices:
Always implement null value handling in your application
Use defensive programming techniques for data processing
Consider fallback values or error handling for critical metrics
Error handling
Structure your code to gracefully handle:

Network timeouts
Rate limiting responses
Invalid parameter errors
Data unavailability periods
Best practices
Rate limits: Adhere to your plan’s rate limits to avoid throttling. Check your dashboard for details.
Error handling: Implement retry logic for transient errors (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests).
Caching: Cache responses for frequently accessed data to reduce API calls and improve performance.
Secure storage: Store your API key securely and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
Errors
Twelve Data API employs a standardized error response format, delivering a JSON object with code, message, and status keys for clear and consistent error communication.

Codes
Below is a table of possible error codes, their HTTP status, meanings, and resolution steps:

Code	status	Meaning	Resolution
400	Bad Request	Invalid or incorrect parameter(s) provided.	Check the message in the response for details. Refer to the API Documenta­tion to correct the input.
401	Unauthor­ized	Invalid or incorrect API key.	Verify your API key is correct. Sign up for a key here.
403	Forbidden	API key lacks permissions for the requested resource (upgrade required).	Upgrade your plan here.
404	Not Found	Requested data could not be found.	Adjust parameters to be less strict as they may be too restrictive.
414	Parameter Too Long	Input parameter array exceeds the allowed length.	Follow the message guidance to adjust the parameter length.
429	Too Many Requests	API request limit reached for your key.	Wait briefly or upgrade your plan here.
500	Internal Server Error	Server-side issue occurred; retry later.	Contact support here for assistance.
Example error response
Consider the following invalid request:

https://api.twelvedata.com/time_series?symbol=AAPL&interval=0.99min&apikey=your_api_key
Due to the incorrect interval value, the API returns:

{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Invalid **interval** provided: 0.99min. Supported intervals: 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 45min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 1day, 1week, 1month",
  "status": "error"
}
Refer to the API Documentation for valid parameter values to resolve such errors.

Technical indicators
On-demand calculation of popular indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.) over any supported time series. Streamline chart overlays, signal generation, and backtesting without external libraries.

Overlap studies
Plotted directly on the price chart to smooth or envelope price data, highlighting trend direction, support/resistance, and mean-reversion levels (e.g. moving averages, Bollinger Bands, Parabolic SAR, Ichimoku Cloud, Keltner Channels, McGinley Dynamic).

Bollinger bands
High demand
/bbands
The Bollinger Bands (BBANDS) endpoint calculates and returns three key data points: an upper band, a lower band, and a simple moving average (SMA) for a specified financial instrument. These bands are used to assess market volatility by showing how far prices deviate from the SMA. This information helps users identify potential price reversals and determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold.

Stochastic fast
/stochf
The Stochastic Fast (STOCHF) endpoint calculates the fast version of the Stochastic Oscillator, providing data on the momentum of a financial instrument by comparing a particular closing price to a range of its prices over a specified period. This endpoint returns the %K and %D values, which are used to identify potential overbought or oversold conditions in the market. It is useful for traders who need quick, responsive insights into price movements, although it may generate more false signals due to its sensitivity.

Correlation
/correl
The Correlation (CORREL) endpoint calculates the statistical relationship between two securities over a specified time period, returning a correlation coefficient. This coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, indicating the strength and direction of their linear relationship. A value close to 1 suggests a strong positive correlation, while a value near -1 indicates a strong negative correlation. This data is useful for identifying securities that move together or in opposite directions, aiding in strategies like diversification or pairs trading.

Advanced
High-throughput and management endpoints for power users—submit and monitor batch jobs to pull large datasets asynchronously, track your API usage and quotas programmatically, and access other developer-focused tools for automating and scaling your data workflows.

Batches
Useful
/batch
The batch request endpoint allows users to request data for multiple financial instruments, time intervals, and data types simultaneously. This endpoint is useful for efficiently gathering diverse financial data in a single operation, reducing the need for multiple individual requests. Errors in specific requests do not affect the processing of others, and each error is reported separately, enabling easy troubleshooting.

Request body
Only JSON POST requests are supported. The request content structure consists of key-value items. The key is a unique request ID. The value is requested url.

Response
The response contains key-value data. The key is a unique request ID. The value is returned data.

API credits
The number of concurrent requests is limited by your subscription plan.
Credits are consumed per requested endpoint, with the total usage equal to the sum of individual requests in the batch.
If the requested data exceeds your available credits, only partial data will be returned asynchronously until your quota is exhausted.
If one or more requests in the batch contain errors (e.g., invalid symbols or unsupported intervals), it will not affect the successful processing of other requests. Errors are reported individually within the response, allowing you to identify and correct specific issues without impacting the entire batch.
Parameters
Response
No parameters are required

WebSocket
WebSocket will automatically send the data to you once a new piece of data is available on the exchange. In the beginning, you need to establish a connection between the server and the client. Then all data is controlled by sending event messages to the server. WebSocket is opposed to the API, where the data has to be explicitly requested from the server.

Overview
You may use the API key to connect to the Twelve Data Distributed WebSocket System (TDDWS). This system will manage all your requests to all available instruments across different exchanges. You can establish up to 3 connections (typically used in production, stage, and local environments) across the whole lifespan of the application; if you open more, the previous connections will be closed.

You may subscribe to all symbols available at Twelve Data; meanwhile, the format remains the same as the API unless there are constraints in the endpoint. Moreover, you may combine symbols across different types, and TDDWS will manage the routing. There are some limitations, though:

Server limits to receive up to 100 events from the client-side. This constraint does not affect the number of messages sent from the server to the client.
There is no limit on the number of input symbols; however, the size of the input message can not exceed 1 MB.
Full WebSocket access is available on the Pro plan (individual) and Venture plan (business), and above. On Basic and Grow individual plans, testing is limited to one connection and up to 8 simultaneous symbol subscriptions from the permitted symbol list.

Resources
You can try streaming via the WebSocket Playground in your dashboard. On Basic and Grow plans, only trial symbols are available. On the Pro plan (individual) and Venture plan (business) and above, any instrument can be streamed.

Response
There are two general return event types: status and price.

Status events return the information about the events itself, which symbols were successfully subscribed/unsubscribed, etc.

Price events return the real-time tick prices for particular instruments. The body will include the meta information, UNIX timestamp, and the price itself. Price events return the real-time tick prices, with the following structure:

Field*	Description
event	type of event
symbol	symbol ticker of instrument
type	general instrument type
timestamp	timestamp in UNIX format
price	real-time price for the underlying instrument
day_volume	volume of the instrument for the current trading day
*Some additional meta response field will be received, depending on the class of the instrument.

Further steps
At this stage you might decide that you no longer want to be subscribed for particular symbols, therefore you have two options:

Manually unsubscribe from symbols. This is done with the same format as the subscription, but with action set to "action": "unsubscribe".
Reset subscription. This will reset your current connection from all subscriptions.
Send the {"action": "reset"} event.
We also recommend sending {"action": "heartbeat"} events to the server every 10 seconds or so. This will make sure to keep your connection stable.

Subscribe to multiple symbols

# You may subscribe to multiple symbols by
# calling subscribe action. Additionally,
# you can pass the exchange name after
# the colon(:).

{
  "action": "subscribe", 
  "params": {
    "symbols": "AAPL,RY,RY:TSX,EUR/USD,BTC/USD"
  }
}
Subscribe using extended format

# Alternatively, if you need to get data from the 
# ambiguos symbol you may use the extended format

{ "action": "subscribe", 
  "params": {
    "symbols": [{
        "symbol": "AAPL",
        "exchange": "NASDAQ"
      }, {
